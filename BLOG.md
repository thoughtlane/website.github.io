# Math Solver: Building Cognitive Skills Through Step-by-Step Learning

**For educators and students who want to understand math, not just get answers.**

---

## Why Step-by-Step Matters

Math is more than answers—it's reasoning. When students see only a final result, they miss how to get there. When they work through steps themselves, they build the habits that last: breaking problems down, checking each step, and fixing mistakes as they go.

Math Solver is built around that idea. It helps students and teachers work with real question sheets, get guided step-by-step support, and—when you want it—see full worked solutions. Everything is designed to support **thinking**, not just correctness.

## What You Can Do

### Work With Your Own Materials

Upload a **photo or PDF** of a math sheet—a quiz, homework, or past paper. Math Solver extracts the questions and presents them in a simple list. You can then:

- **Solve** and see full step-by-step solutions for each question.
- **Practice** with Cognitive Helper: solve each question yourself, one step at a time, with hints and validation.
- **Extend practice** by generating similar questions for extra drills.
- **Export** results as PDF or editable DOCX for handouts or portfolios.

No need to retype problems; your existing sheets become the starting point.

### Two Ways to Use It

**1. Solver — See full solutions**

When you want to *see* how a problem is done: run the Solver. You get a full step-by-step solution for each question. Use it to prepare answer keys, review a topic, or compare different solution paths. You can solve all questions at once or one at a time, and download the results.

**2. Cognitive Helper — Do it yourself, with support**

When you want students to *do* the work: use Cognitive Helper. Students see one question at a time and type their own steps in a math-friendly editor. As they work:

- **Hints** — At any step they can ask for a suggestion for the *next* step (not the full answer). They stay in the driver's seat.
- **Step checking** — When they move to the next line, the previous step can be checked. If something is wrong, they get feedback and can correct it before moving on.
- **Chat** — They can ask follow-up questions about the problem and get explanations.
- **Progress** — The app tracks hints used, steps corrected, steps done on their own, and questions completed, so students and teachers can see how practice is going.

Progress is saved so they can leave and come back to the same question set later.

## How It Helps Educators

- **Use your own content** — Any worksheet, quiz, or test you already use can be uploaded and used in Solver or Cognitive Helper.
- **Differentiate** — Use Solver for answer keys and review; use Cognitive Helper for in-class or homework practice where students work through steps.
- **See where students struggle** — Cognitive Helper's stats (hints used, steps marked wrong, steps on their own) give a simple view of where support is needed.
- **Create more practice** — Generate similar questions from existing ones to build extra sets without writing new problems by hand.
- **Share results** — Export solutions or student work as PDF or DOCX for grading, portfolios, or parent communication.

## How It Helps Students (Cognitive Skills)

Cognitive Helper is built to support the kind of practice that strengthens reasoning, not just memory.

- **Chunking** — Students work one step at a time. They learn to break a problem into smaller pieces instead of guessing at a single big answer.
- **Self-explanation** — Writing each step (with optional hints) encourages them to articulate *why* that step is there, which deepens understanding.
- **Error detection and correction** — Step checking gives quick feedback. Fixing mistakes in the moment helps them build a habit of checking their work and revising.
- **Calibrated support** — Hints suggest the next step without giving the full solution. They learn to use support when stuck while still doing the reasoning themselves.
- **Persistence** — Progress is saved. They can tackle a few questions, leave, and return later, which supports spaced practice and reduces pressure to finish everything in one go.

The goal is to make practice feel like a **guided workout** for mathematical thinking: students do the work, get feedback at the right grain size, and build confidence and skill over time.

## Summary

Math Solver gives you:

- **Upload** — Your sheets (images or PDFs) become the source of questions.
- **Step-by-step solutions** — When you want to see how a problem is done (Solver).
- **Guided practice** — When you want students to do it themselves with hints and step checking (Cognitive Helper).
- **Similar questions** — Extra practice sets generated from your questions.
- **Export** — PDF and DOCX so you can use results outside the app.

No implementation details—just features that help educators teach and students learn, one step at a time.
